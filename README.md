**Algowords (Alpha)** is a free e-learning website open to all ages, with two separate subjects for Grade 8 and Grade 9. Our project started last February for school purposes and was initially released (Beta) on March 14. On June 10, 2025, the Lead Developer of Algowords utterly canceled the project, and it will no longer be updated.

**UPDATE**
Algowords has no standing developers to maintain the project itself. It will remain publicly open for anyone to improve.

**Patch Note**

As of June 10, 2025. V1.5 Alpha.

Added Subscription.
Fixed Minor bugs.
